Phase II: Todo Full-Stack Web Application

Basic Level Functionality

Objective: Using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus transform the console app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage.

💡Development Approach: Use the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

Requirements

Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application

Create RESTful API endpoints

Build responsive frontend interface

Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database

Authentication – Implement user signup/signin using Better Auth

Securing the REST API

Better Auth + FastAPI Integration

The Challenge

Better Auth is a JavaScript/TypeScript authentication library that runs on your Next.js frontend. However, your FastAPI backend is a separate Python service that needs to verify which user is making API requests.

The Solution: JWT Tokens

Better Auth can be configured to issue JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens when users log in. These tokens are self-contained credentials that include user information and can be verified by any service that knows the secret key.

How It Works

User logs in on Frontend → Better Auth creates a session and issues a JWT token

Frontend makes API call → Includes the JWT token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header

Backend receives request → Extracts token from header, verifies signature using shared secret

Backend identifies user → Decodes token to get user ID, email, etc. and matches it with the user ID in the URL

Backend filters data → Returns only tasks belonging to that user

What Needs to Change

Component

Changes Required

Better Auth Config

Enable JWT plugin to issue tokens

Frontend API Client

Attach JWT token to every API request header

FastAPI Backend

Add middleware to verify JWT and extract user

API Routes

Filter all queries by the authenticated user's ID



The Shared Secret

Both frontend (Better Auth) and backend (FastAPI) must use the same secret key for JWT signing and verification. This is typically set via environment variable BETTER\_AUTH\_SECRET in both services.

Security Benefits

Benefit

Description

User Isolation

Each user only sees their own tasks

Stateless Auth

Backend doesn't need to call frontend to verify users

Token Expiry

JWTs expire automatically (e.g., after 7 days)

No Shared DB Session

Frontend and backend can verify auth independently



API Behavior Change

After Auth:

All endpoints require valid JWT token

Requests without token receive 401 Unauthorized

Each user only sees/modifies their own tasks

Task ownership is enforced on every operation



Bottom Line

The REST API endpoints stay the same (GET /api/user\_id/tasks, POST /api/user\_id/tasks, etc.), but every request now must include a JWT token, and all responses are filtered to only include that user's data.





Monorepo Organization For Full-Stack Projects With GitHub Spec-Kit + Claude Code

This guide explains how to organize your Full-Stack Projects in a monorepo to integrate GitHub Spec-Kit for spec-driven development with Claude Code. This guide explains how to organize your repository so that Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus can effectively edit both frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) code in a single context.

\# Todo App - Hackathon II

 

\## Project Overview

This is a monorepo using GitHub Spec-Kit for spec-driven development.

 

\## Spec-Kit Structure

Specifications are organized in /specs:

\- /specs/overview.md - Project overview

\- /specs/features/ - Feature specs (what to build)

\- /specs/api/ - API endpoint and MCP tool specs

\- /specs/database/ - Schema and model specs

\- /specs/ui/ - Component and page specs

 

\## How to Use Specs

1\. Always read relevant spec before implementing

2\. Reference specs with: @specs/features/task-crud.md

3\. Update specs if requirements change

 

\## Project Structure

\- /frontend - Next.js 14 app

\- /backend - Python FastAPI server

 

\## Development Workflow

1\. Read spec: @specs/features/\[feature].md

2\. Implement backend: @backend/CLAUDE.md

3\. Implement frontend: @frontend/CLAUDE.md

4\. Test and iterate

 

\## Commands

\- Frontend: cd frontend \&\& npm run dev

\- Backend: cd backend \&\& uvicorn main:app --reload

\- Both: docker-compose up

Frontend CLAUDE.md

\# Frontend Guidelines

 

\## Stack

\- Next.js 14 (App Router)

\- TypeScript

\- Tailwind CSS

 

\## Patterns

\- Use server components by default

\- Client components only when needed (interactivity)

\- API calls go through `/lib/api.ts`

 

\## Component Structure

\- `/components` - Reusable UI components

\- `/app` - Pages and layouts

 

\## API Client

All backend calls should use the api client:

 

import { api } from '@/lib/api'

const tasks = await api.getTasks()

 

\## Styling

\- Use Tailwind CSS classes

\- No inline styles

\- Follow existing component patterns



Backend CLAUDE.md

\# Backend Guidelines

 

\## Stack

\- FastAPI

\- SQLModel (ORM)

\- Neon PostgreSQL

 

\## Project Structure

\- `main.py` - FastAPI app entry point

\- `models.py` - SQLModel database models

\- `routes/` - API route handlers

\- `db.py` - Database connection

 

\## API Conventions

\- All routes under `/api/`

\- Return JSON responses

\- Use Pydantic models for request/response

\- Handle errors with HTTPException

 

\## Database

\- Use SQLModel for all database operations

\- Connection string from environment variable: DATABASE\_URL

 

\## Running

uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

Workflow with Spec-KitPlus + Claude Code

Write/Update Spec → @specs/features/new-feature.md

Ask Claude Code to Implement → "Implement @specs/features/new-feature.md"

Claude Code reads: Root CLAUDE.md, Feature spec, API spec, Database spec, Relevant CLAUDE.md

Claude Code implements in both frontend and backend

Test and iterate on spec if needed

Referencing Specs in Claude Code

\# Implement a feature

\# Implement API

You: @specs/api/rest-endpoints.md implement the GET /api/tasks endpoint

 

\# Update database

You: @specs/database/schema.md add due\_date field to tasks

 

\# Full feature across stack

Key Point:

Spec-Kit Plus provides organized, structured specs that Claude Code can reference. The CLAUDE.md files tell Claude Code how to use those specs and project-specific conventions.



Summary: Monorepo vs Separate Repos

Approach

Pros

Cons

Monorepo ⭐

Single CLAUDE.md context, easier cross-cutting changes

Larger repo

Separate Repos

Clear separation, independent deployments

Claude Code needs workspace setup



Recommendation:

Use monorepo for the hackathon – simpler for Claude Code to navigate and edit both frontend and backend in a single context.

Key Benefits of This Structure
