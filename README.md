# Phase 2 TODO Application

Welcome to the Phase 2 TODO Application project! This is a full-stack TODO application built using a specialized agent-based development approach.

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive TODO application with user authentication, task management, and a responsive frontend. The development approach leverages specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of the application, ensuring efficient and focused development across frontend, backend, and infrastructure concerns.

## Project Scope

The Phase 2 TODO Application encompasses:

- **Authentication System**: Secure user registration, login, and session management
- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for user tasks
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: Modern frontend and robust backend integration
- **Database Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of user data and tasks
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication and authorization
- **Testing**: Integration and unit testing for reliable functionality

## Specialized Agents

This project utilizes specialized AI agents to handle different development aspects:

- **Auth-Security Agent**: Manages authentication and security features, including Better Auth integration and JWT token handling
- **DB Architect Agent**: Designs and manages database models, connections, and migrations using SQLModel and Neon PostgreSQL
- **FastAPI Backend Engineer**: Develops secure REST API endpoints with proper user data protection
- **Fullstack Todo Agent**: Implements features spanning both backend and frontend components
- **NextJS Frontend Agent**: Builds the Next.js frontend with authentication and task management interfaces
- **Integration Tester**: Verifies that frontend and backend components work together properly
- **Project Coordinator**: Organizes the monorepo structure and manages infrastructure files
- **Spec Writer Documentation Agent**: Creates and maintains specification documents

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI with JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16+ with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with SQLModel
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with JWT tokens
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for containerization

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Secure task management with user isolation
- Responsive web interface
- Real-time task updates
- Protected routes and user data privacy

## Getting Started

Detailed setup instructions will be added as the project develops. Each specialized agent contributes to different aspects of the application, allowing for parallel development and expertise-focused implementation.

## Contributing

This project uses a unique agent-based development methodology. Contributions should align with the specialized roles of each agent to maintain consistency and efficiency.
